# Project Status

Last updated: 2026-06-17

## Active Objective

ExECTv2 is now the forward workstream. Use the Gan 2026 closeout as the strategy
template for full deterministic, LLM-only, and hybrid runs: source-near state,
exact evidence, component attribution, benchmark-format ablations, and
family-aware promotion gates. Use `gpt-4.1-mini` for rapid loops; keep Qwen
3.6:35B as a later overnight transfer track.

## Recent Context

- Split discipline remains intact. Gan `test450` remains aggregate-only for
  development; ExECTv2 full-200 audits are blocked until a GPT-first architecture
  has benchmark-beating dev evidence and a predeclared readout. Gan is closed:
  V12 fresh-evidence hybrid ceiling `379/450` Purist (`0.842`); recommended
  simple labeler `364/450` Purist (`0.809`).
- GPT-first ExECTv2 strategy:
  `docs/research/exectv2_gpt_first_full_architecture_strategy_2026-06-17.md`.
  Freeze blockers: rules-only all-9 below target, LLM-only all-9 still a
  negative single-pass baseline, and hybrid evidence still SF-only.
- Deterministic all-9 dev scorecard:
  `experiments/exectv2_deterministic_all9_dev_20260617.md`; benchmark `0.3625`
  item / `0.6747` letter. PatientHistory is conservative at `0.2087` item /
  `0.5475` letter with `157/157` emitted mentions carrying CUI.
- Shared `project_cuis` is now wired into ExECTv2 LLM-only and hybrid
  post-steps, including SeizureFrequency. The source-near/semantic layers remain
  inspectable while benchmark-format CUI projection is counted separately.

## Active Priorities

1. Execute GPT-first ExECTv2: deterministic all-9, per-entity LLM-only
   mention frames, and hybrid live candidate assessment.
2. Require benchmark-beating dev evidence before any new full-200 audit:
   overall `0.87` per-item / `0.90` per-letter, plus per-entity tables,
   evidence/schema reliability, semantic-vs-CUI gaps, and ablations.

## Work Board

### Now

- Run GPT per-entity LLM-only pilots for the entities most likely to move the
  overall benchmark fastest: Prescription, Investigations, Diagnosis, then
  SeizureFrequency as the hard transfer check.
- Add an ExECTv2 projection-gap ledger before promoting any architecture:
  phrase scope, CUI, attribute bundle, split/merge, current-regimen errors,
  source/defaulted frequency, future medication, weight dosing, and rescue mismatch.

### Next

- Extend the hybrid live candidate-assessment pattern from SF to all nine
  entities, using deterministic and GPT mention-frame outputs as candidate
  sources rather than hidden final truth.

### Blocked

- Gan holdout-facing reruns, row-level test analysis, or post-test tuning remain
  blocked without explicit authorization and a frozen protocol.
- New ExECTv2 full-200 audits are blocked until benchmark-beating GPT-first dev
  evidence and a predeclared aggregate readout.

### Backlog

- Resume ExECTv2 Qwen event-frame dev25/dev140 after GPT choices are clearer.

### Done Recently

- 2026-06-17: Extended shared benchmark-format CUI projection to
  SeizureFrequency and wired `project_cuis` into LLM-only SF, LLM-only all-entity,
  clinical-findings, and hybrid post-steps. Preserved explicit
  format/semantic-vs-CUI layers for ablation. Verified `1573` tests pass and
  Ruff on touched files; full-project Ruff remains blocked by pre-existing lint
  in old experiment/test surfaces.
- 2026-06-17: Completed the deterministic all-9 substrate: Prescription,
  Investigations, Diagnosis, Onset, WhenDiagnosed, BirthHistory, EpilepsyCause,
  PatientHistory, SeizureFrequency, and the Prescription clinical headline plus
  benchmark projection ladder. Current all-9 dev benchmark `0.3625` item /
  `0.6747` letter.
- 2026-06-14 to 2026-06-17: Closed the Gan strand and wrote the GPT-first
  ExECTv2 architecture strategy; Qwen moved to an overnight transfer track.

## Guardrails

- Do not inspect Gan `test450` row-level failures, rationales, evidence,
  selected events, or transitions for development.
- New Gan holdout-facing runs require explicit frozen-protocol authorization.
- Keep architecture claims attribution-clean across `rules_only`, `llm_only`,
  and `hybrid`.
- Treat Gan-specific rules and benchmark-format repairs as controlled variables,
  not hidden implementation detail.
